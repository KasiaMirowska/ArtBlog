## “If we have the attitude that it’s going to be a great day it usually is.” – Catherine Pulsifier
<br/>
My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: 
<br/>
that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. 
<br/>
Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it... 
<br/>
but love it.
— Nietzsche

<br/>
“The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. 
<br/>
It’s what you’re made of. Not the circumstances.” – Unknown
