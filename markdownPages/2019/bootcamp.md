## Started at Thinkful...

“Do one thing every day that scares you.”― Eleanor Roosevelt

<br/>
That definielty summs up 2019 for me, lol!
<br/> 
Study, struggle, make mistakes, repeat...
<br/>
Every day was scary and every day I succeded because I didn't quit.
<br/>
That's one thing we should always demand of ourselves...

Our greatest glory consists not in never failing, but in rising every time we fall.
