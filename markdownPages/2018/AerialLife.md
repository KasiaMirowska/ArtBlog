## I love aerial-silks.

When I don't work or study code or teach yoga you will find me in the air.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a not so flattering video of me training in silks...I am not good, I am a begginer but I LOVE BEING IN THE AIR! 
<br/>
and I love learning, overcoming limitations, daily improving myself...
