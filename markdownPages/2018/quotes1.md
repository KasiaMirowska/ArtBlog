## "People are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them." — Epictetus

<br />

 “Don’t limit yourself. 
 <br />
 Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. 
 <br />
 You can go as far as your mind lets you. 
 <br />What you believe, remember, you can achieve.” – Mary Kay Ash
